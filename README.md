# HelpGuide’s Story
HelpGuide is dedicated to Morgan Leslie Segal, who died by suicide in 1996 at the age of 29. Described as “a rare and beautiful soul,” “a rising talented writer,” and “a young woman with great intelligence and sensitivity,” Morgan nevertheless grappled with a condition that started as low self-esteem and worsened into major depression. Six years of therapy and a variety of drug prescriptions did not help her.

Following Morgan’s death, her parents Robert and Jeanne Segal began sharing their grief and discovered that all too many others had experienced similar struggles. “The pain was so evident,” said Robert, “the subject so frightening, hidden, and loaded with stigma, that they don’t know where to turn.” They concluded that the best way to honor the memory of their daughter was by helping people in similar trouble by guiding them toward appropriate information and care.

And so HelpGuide was born.
